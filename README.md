# fasda-utils
Optional utilities for working with FASDA files.

These tools are separated from the main FASDA distribution because of
the massive dependencies required by the seaborn python library.
We do not want to make FASDA packages huge and risk build failures of
the core package for the sake of utilities that not everyone will use.
